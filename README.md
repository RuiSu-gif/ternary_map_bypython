# Ternary map by Python (test)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and visualizing data using ternary plots. Ternary plots are useful for displaying the proportions of three variables that sum to a constant. 


## Contents

- `ternary_fig_share.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for creating ternary plots.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `ternary`
- `cartopy`
- `gdal`

## Data prepare
- Prepare your data for ternary plotting.
- `The dataset should contain three TIFF files representing the proportions of three factors (summing to 1).`
- `省.shp and 十段线.shp are boundaries.shp`
## Note
Please note that the map and legend are drawn separately and need to be combined later.
